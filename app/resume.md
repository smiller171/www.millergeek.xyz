## Summary

I'm a DevOps Engineer focused on modern cloud-native stacks, especially in AWS. Over the last ten years I've built expertise at all levels of DevOps process, tooling, and culture. I'm focused on driving change in the interest of making developer's work easier by reducing friction and shortening the dev/test/deploy feedback loop as much as possible.
