## About Me
I'm a Software and DevOps Engineer with a perfectionist streak. I enjoy working with developers to optimize workflows and fix pain points, improving deployment pipelines, processes, tooling, and everything in between. I put a lot of value in shortening the dev/test feedback loop, and will chase down anything I can use to make testing and deployment as fast as possible. If a solution to a problem exists, I will find it.

I shine the most when I have the freedom to identify the areas where I can have the most impact and build solutions to hard problems, both technical and cultural. I'm currently looking for new opportunities, so if you're looking for someone to lead your DevOps strategy or expand your software team, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I built this site from scratch with Vue 3 using VitePress. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/smiller171/www.millergeek.xyz)
