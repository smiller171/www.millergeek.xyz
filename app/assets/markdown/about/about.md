## About Me
I'm a DevOps Engineer and Web Developer. I live and breathe tech, spending much of my time keeping up with the bleeding edge of infrastructure and security tools. This site is built with Vue, prerendered with Nuxt, and hosted from Netlify.

I shine the most when I can interface with developers to identify pain points and solve those issues with new systems, be it DevOps processes, infrastructure automation, or application architecture changes. I'm currently looking for new opportunities, so if you're looking for someone to lead your DevOps strategy, please don't hesitate to reach out.
